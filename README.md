The NYT Crossword app has a mode called "Spelling Bee" which gives 7 letters where 1 is required. The goal is to make as many words 4 letters or longer. Each set puzzle includes at least 1 "pangram" which uses all 7 letters at least once.

This program takes a wordlist, the 7 letters of the Spelling Bee puzzle, the required letter, and produces a subset of the word list which satisfies the requirements of the puzzle.
